Welcome to my foodsby web app!

In order to run my app, all that has to be done is to have Node.js installed, open the command prompt, navigate to the folder with the project in it, and type in $ node app.js. Once the server is running, you can look at the webpage by going to your browser and typing in http://localhost:8888/index.html. This should direct you to the main page. There are only two pages for this website. The first is built using Javascript from restaurants.js. All the pictures and information on the page are pulled from the Javascript object notation. I copied the information from deliveries-sample.json into restaurants.js. Once there, I read through the object and used a couple loops to build the rest of the html page. There are only a few parts that are interactive:

-The pills, that when selected, change what restaurants are displayed on the page.
-The Foodsby logo in the navbar, which when clicked, bring you back to the top of index.html.
-The buttons for each restaurant, which when clicked, redirects you to selection.html and puts the values from the index of the days and from the restaurants into the url.

I then used this information to again pull the information for the restaurant selected, and display it on the new page. I also looked up all the actual photos of the restaurants to make the page look a little better. Thank you and I hope you enjoy my webpage!
